# Hybrid Node Functionality Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Node Type Change Cleanup

-   **Problem**: When changing node type from hybrid to another type (e.g., controller), old properties like `storageDisks` and `hybridRoles` remained.
-   **Solution**: Enhanced the `updateNodeField` function to clean up incompatible properties when node type changes:
    -   `controller`: Removes `storageDisks` and `hybridRoles`
    -   `network`: Removes `storageDisks`, `vipExternalNic`, and `hybridRoles`
    -   `compute`: Removes `storageDisks`, `vipExternalNic`, and `hybridRoles`
    -   `storage`: Removes `vipExternalNic` and `hybridRoles`, adds storage disk if needed
    -   `hybrid`: Initializes `hybridRoles` with default values

### 2. Hybrid Role Selection UI

-   **Problem**: Hybrid nodes were forced to have all roles without user choice.
-   **Solution**: Added a checkbox interface for hybrid nodes allowing users to select which roles to enable:
    -   Controller role
    -   Network role
    -   Compute role
    -   Storage role
-   **Features**:
    -   Warning when no roles are selected
    -   Dynamic management of storage disks based on storage role selection
    -   Dynamic management of VIP external NIC based on controller role selection

### 3. Validation Logic Enhancement

-   **Problem**: Validation didn't check if all required roles were present across the deployment.
-   **Solution**:
    -   Added `getAllRoles` helper function to extract all roles from nodes including hybrid roles
    -   Updated validation to check for all required roles: controller, network, compute, storage
    -   Added validation for hybrid nodes to ensure at least one role is selected
    -   Enhanced error messages to be more descriptive

### 4. UI Improvements

-   **VIP External NIC**: Now shows for controller nodes AND hybrid nodes with controller role enabled
-   **Storage Disks**: Now shows for storage nodes AND hybrid nodes with storage role enabled
-   **Role-based warnings**: Updated tunnel IP warnings to account for hybrid node roles

## Key Functions Added/Modified

1. **`updateNodeField`**: Enhanced to clean up properties when node type changes
2. **`updateHybridRole`**: New function to manage hybrid role selection and related properties
3. **`getAllRoles`**: Helper function to extract all roles from deployment including hybrid roles
4. **`validateConfiguration`**: Enhanced to validate all required roles are present and hybrid nodes have roles selected

## Benefits

-   **Clean State Management**: Node type changes no longer leave irrelevant properties
-   **Flexible Hybrid Nodes**: Users can choose which roles hybrid nodes should fulfill
-   **Comprehensive Validation**: Ensures all required roles are present in the deployment
-   **Better UX**: Clear warnings and dynamic UI based on node configuration
